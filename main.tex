\section{Tournament Information}


\subsection{Tournament Management Platform}
Faceit?
Discord? (dathost servers)


\subsection{Tournament Format}
The tournament will use a Swiss System. After the Swiss rounds, there will be two semifinal matches to determine the two finalists and 
one grand final match to determine the winner of the tournament. Both semifinals and the grand finals will be played in Best-of-3's.

\subsection{Timeouts during a Game}
There are three different types of timeouts that can occur during a match:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Technical Timeout}: In case of Connection issues, equipment/hardware issues or any other kind of technical problems, the teams can pause the game by using the command "!pause". The pause will take effect as soon as the next freeze time starts.
    \item \textbf{Tactical Timeout}: Every team can use two (2) tactical timeouts per map. These timeouts last 30 seconds and can be called at any time during the game, with the command "!tac". The timeout will start with the next freeze time.
    \item \textbf{Admin timeout}: An Admin can set up a timeout at any time of the game at his own discretion. The pause becomes active with the next freeze time. It is mandatory that the admin informs the teams about the reason for the timeout in due time.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Mappool}
The tournament will use the official map pool of CS2, which is:
\begin{itemize}
    \item de\_anubis
    \item de\_ancient
    \item de\_inferno
    \item de\_mirage
    \item de\_nuke
    \item de\_overpass
    \item de\_vertigo 
\end{itemize}
Should the official map pool of CS2 be changed during the season, the changes will not be implemented until at least one (1) week after
the change is announced. That change will be communicated to the teams via the Discord server.

\subsection{Ban-System}
In the Swiss rounds, both teams ban maps until only one is left over. Meaning, "Team A" bans first and then "Team B" bans and then "Team A"
bans again and so on. (Bans will look like this: A-B-A-B-A-B)\\
\\
\noindent
For the semifinals and the grand finals, there will be a "Pick-Ban-System", where "Team A" will ban one map, "Team B" will ban one map, 
"Team A" picks one map, "Team B" picks one map, "Team A" bans one map and "Team B" bans one map which leaves the Best-of-3 with the 
two map picks of the teams and the remaining map will be used as a decider should the need occur. \\
\\
Additionally, "Team B" gets to choose what side to start on, on "Team A"'s pick and vice versa. So if "Team A" picks Inferno, "Team B" 
can choose to start on CT.\\
On the decider map, the sides will be chosen by knife round. 



\subsection{Match Hosting}
All games will be hosted on Faceit.


\subsection{Overtime}
If a map ends in a tie (15:15) the teams will play Overtime. Overtime consists of six (6) rounds, three on each side. Both teams start the
halves with \$10,000 starting money for each player. If after six rounds, the tie hasn't been broken, another overtime will be played. This process is repeated until a winner is found. 


\subsection{Bugs and Glitches}
Any bug or glitch must be reported to the admins immediately via the in game chat. If the error is reported before any damage was dealt to a player on the server, an admin will reset the round. \\
\\
A round is always "live" (meaning a round should be played as if nothing is wrong) until an admin says otherwise (via in game chat "not 
live", "nicht live"). A finished round may only be reset in case of a serious error/problem, or if the error/problem was reported before
any damage was dealt to a player. 




\subsection{Cheating}
Any form of cheating, defined by the administrators, will result in an immediate exclusion from the tournament. In the case of a player 
cheating (here defined as using any form of software or hardware to gain an unfair advantage over the other team, e.g.: wallhacks, 
radarhacks, aimbots, any sort of scripts to improve movement in game or antiaim-hacks, use of pixelboosts,  etc.) said player can not 
participate in the League again for at least two years but depending on the severity, the player may be banned permanently. The remainder
of the team will be allowed to play again in the 
next season. A banned player trying to participate in a season while still banned (i.e. ban evading), will result in said player being
banned permanently.\\
\\




\subsection{Streaming your own Games}
The streaming and broadcasting of games within the Charity League requires the permission of the
administration. Every stream has a 120-second mandatory stream delay. If a stream doesn't conform to 
these rules, the team violating said rules will receive sanctions.
